Project 4 - Object Oriented Programming: Game Show App

--Description
This app creates a word game in your web browser. The objective of the game is to guess a phrase by typing letters on your keyboard or clicking letters on screen. After five attempts, the user loses and must generate a new game. If the phrase is guessed, user is returned to the main screen and may start a new game.

--Skills and Process
Skills: classes, callback functions, DOM manipulation, Event Handlers
-This app utilizes object oriented programmimng to create two classes, Game and Phrase.
-App.js creates event listeners which instantiate a new Game object. 
-Game object then instantiates new Phrase object and calls game object or phrase object methods to verify key presses or button clicks to match letters on screen. If the user successfully guesses phrase, or runs out of attempts the Game class calls an endGame method, resetting the game, and returning the user to the main screen with a custom win/lose message.

--Project Attempt
Exceeds Expectations
-Adds keyboard functionality
-Adds a couple css additions, to spice up the landing page and the game while it runs.
